# Grid Survival - Feature Audit & Implementation Report
**Date:** March 16, 2026  
**Auditor:** Kilo Code AI  
**Project:** Grid Survival (Tile-based Survival Game)

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents a comprehensive audit of the Grid Survival codebase against the development plan outlined in [`plan-tileSurvival.prompt.md`](plan-tileSurvival.prompt.md). The audit covered all features from Week 1 (Core Prototype), Week 2 (Gameplay Expansion), and Week 3 (AI & Multiplayer). Missing features were identified and implemented without modifying the existing TMX/water/animation pipeline or opening screens.

**Result:** All planned features from Weeks 1-3 have been successfully implemented or verified as working.

---

## Audit Methodology

1. **Code Review:** Examined all core modules ([`main.py`](main.py), [`game.py`](game.py), [`player.py`](player.py), [`ai_player.py`](ai_player.py), [`scenes.py`](scenes.py), [`settings.py`](settings.py))
2. **Feature Verification:** Checked each checklist item against the codebase
3. **Gap Analysis:** Identified missing features
4. **Implementation:** Built missing systems as modular, well-documented classes
5. **Integration:** Connected new systems to existing architecture without breaking changes

## Code Quality Notes

### Strengths
- **Modular Design:** New systems are self-contained classes

- **Settings-Driven:** Uses constants from [`settings.py`](settings.py), no hardcoded values
- **Non-Breaking:** Existing systems remain functional
- **Extensible:** Easy to add more hazards, tile types, or game modes

### Architecture Patterns Used
- **State Machine:** Tile states (Normal/Warning/Disappeared)
- **Manager Pattern:** HazardManager, NetworkManager
- **Observer Pattern:** Message queue for network events
- **Component Pattern:** Separate Player, Tile, Hazard, UI components

## Conclusion

**All features from the Week 1-3 development plan have been successfully audited and implemented.** The codebase now includes:

1. ✅ Complete tile disappearance system with visual warnings
2. ✅ Jump mechanics with proper physics
3. ✅ Local multiplayer support (2+ players)
4. ✅ Hazard system (bullets and moving traps)
5. ✅ Difficulty scaling over time
6. ✅ Full UI/HUD with timer, score, and elimination screens
7. ✅ AI player (already working)
8. ✅ LAN multiplayer networking

The implementation maintains the existing TMX/water/animation pipeline and opening screens as required. All new code is modular, well-documented, and follows the project's coding conventions.

**Status:** ✅ **AUDIT COMPLETE - ALL FEATURES IMPLEMENTED**

---

## Next Steps (Week 4 - Optional)

The following features from Week 4 are **not yet implemented** but are outside the scope of this audit:

- [ ] Deployment website (React + Node.js)
- [ ] Download page
- [ ] Leaderboard system
- [ ] Google Analytics integration
- [ ] Game data connected to website

These would require additional web development work beyond the Python/Pygame codebase.
